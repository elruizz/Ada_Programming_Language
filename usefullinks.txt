If you use ATOM.io for editing code. You can import the ada language.
Use this command inside the .atom/preferences folder:

apm init --package language-ada --convert https://github.com/textmate/ada.tmbundle.git

List of all the libraries in Ada:

Useful topics:
To Create and Run an Ada Program:
1. Install the Ada compiler
2. Create a project (directory)
3. Create and edit file(s) containing Ada source code
4. Compile the source code, creating object code
5. Link the object code, creating a program
6. Run the resulting program
7. (Optionally) Debug the resulting program

Things I've learned:
1. packages can contain multiple procedures
2. need to compile each individual .adb file. These are the bodies
3. Do not need to compile the .ads
3b. If we wanna check the semantics of our .ads file. use extension -gnatc
        ex: gcc -c greetings.ads -gnatc

One way to compile:
gcc -c gmain.adb
gcc - greetings.adb
gnatbind gmain
gnatlink gmain

ORRRR
gnatmake gmain.adb  (much fREAKIN easier)


if you edit gmain.adb, you only need to recompile that file. But if you edit greetings.ads,
you must recompile both greetings.adb and gmain.adb, because both files contain units that depend on greetings.ads.

gnatbind will warn you if you forget one of these compilation steps,
so that it is impossible to generate an inconsistent program as a result of forgetting to do a compilation.

An Ada `compilation' (which is a sequence of compilation units) is represented using a sequence of files.
Similarly, you will place each subunit or child unit in a separate file.


* If a package spec has no body, compile the package spec to produce the object file for the package.
* If a package has both a spec and a body, compile the body to produce the object file for the package.
The source file for the package spec need not be compiled in this case because there is only one object file,
    which contains the code for both the spec and body of the package.
* For a subprogram, compile the subprogram body to produce the object file for the subprogram.
    The spec, if one is present, is as usual in a separate file, and need not be compiled.

* In the case of subunits, only compile the parent unit.
 A single object file is generated for the entire subunit tree, which includes all the subunits.
* Compile child units independently of their parent units (though, of course, the spec of all the ancestor unit must be present in order to compile a child unit).
* Compile generic units in the same manner as any other units. The object files in this case are small dummy files that contain
  at most the flag used for elaboration checking. This is because GNAT always handles generic instantiation by means of macro expansion. However, it is still necessary to compile generic units, for dependency checking and elaboration purposes.
